# hangman

This project is a little game of hangman.

The player must guess the word guessed by another player after a certain number of attempts. When all attempts are over, the game completely draws a gallows
and the hanged man on it.

The game runs entirely in the terminal.

The list of words is entered directly into the code in the "words" variable. The game randomly selects one word from a given list.
